      "IPython is a <i>very</i> cool interface to Python which allows you to use or create interactive notebooks. IPython notebooks can contain markdown text such as this cell, Python code, and IPython \"magic functions\" that can do some handy tricks as you will see below.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's talk about cell types. There are four basic cell types:\n",
      "1. Heading cells, such as the cell above.\n",
      "2. Markdown cells, such as this cell.</li>\n",
      "3. Code cells where Python code and \"magic functions\" are stored and results of that code may be shown.</li> \n",
      "4. Raw cells where you can write *output* directly. Raw cells are not evaluated or rendered by IPython.</li>\n",
      " \n",
      "## Viewing a Cell-Type ##\n",
      "If you single left-click your mouse to select the cell above (\"The Basics of Using IPython\") you will see in the IPython toolbar that the first cell of this notebook is a \"Heading 1\" cell. \n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Viewing a Cell's Actual Markdown Text</h2>\n",
      "Go ahead and double-click your mouse on -->this cell<-- and expose its unrendered contents. You will see it is a \"Markdown\" cell and that I've mixed some <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\" target=\"_blank\">markdown</a> *and* HTML. \n",
      "\n",
      "Using markdown cells, such as these, allow you to organize your notebook, explain the code found in code cells, and perhaps tell your readers what results to expect when code is executed or the code is changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you single-click onto another cell you will notice the markdown does not automatically display the rendered version of a cell while it is in edit mode. Select this cell again and press Shift-Enter. That evaluates or renders the contents of the cell. If it's markdown the text will be rendered. If it's a code cell, the code in that cell will be executed. Go ahead and hit Shift-Enter (or Shift-Return on a Mac) to render the contents of this cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Markdown cells can be quite simple or can display complex LaTeX formatting. If you want more information about cell types and what's allowed in each you can find that information here:\n",
